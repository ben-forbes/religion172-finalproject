								<h2>Importance of Studying TikTok</h2>
							</header>
							<p>TikTok is a short-form media app that has taken the social media space by storm in the last decade. What sets itself apart from other social media giants YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram, is the creative freedom that is allowed for creators, and the ways in which users can interact with content. Specifically, creators can piggyback off the videos of others, “dueting” their videos (putting their own video side by side with the original video) and spreading their content even further. Another novel concept that TikTok brings to the table is the “For You” page, a continuous scrolling feed of videos that the algorithm has determined you would like. TikTok videos are organized in a scrolling format and the content is tailored to you, meaning that the scrolling can go on forever. </p>
							<p>The addictive nature of TikTok is concerning considering the app has amassed over 1 billion users as of September 2021. Additionally, the app is a favorite of the youngest generations. Polling by JoyVentures states that 20% of Gen Z spends more than 5 hours on the platform every day. The popularity and the addictive nature of TikTok means the app has significant power to influence people, specifically Gen Z. </p>
							<p>In the context of Forbes and Mahan’s principle of religion in conversation with media, Evangelical Christians have found their own niche on the app. Various hashtags like, “#christian, #bibleverse, and #jesus”, bring videos into easily searchable groups, or are recommended by the algorithm. The real-world impact of TikTok and its ability to evangelize is summed up by the story of Liana Gordan, 17-year-old Evangelical TikToker who says, “God used TikTok to save me”. According to Evy Lyons, VP of marketing at influencer marketing firm Traackr these hashtags have driven, “more than 169 million engagements in 2020”. </p>
							<p>The influence of TikTok on real life is undoubtedly real, especially in the Christian space. Through an analysis of three popular Christian TikTokers, I will show how Evangelical Christians are using TikTok as an opportunity to market their religion to Gen Z through subtle messaging and overt content. </p>

								<h2>Drakes Kitchen: Subtle Messaging</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Drakes Kitchen first started posting videos in July of 2022. The account started out by posting cooking videos that garnered around a thousand views per video. By September though, Drakes Kitchen had posted several videos that captured up to 15 thousand views. Now, Drakes Kitchen has videos that have almost 10 million views. The account specializes in goofy cooking videos will questionable techniques, horrible spelling, and hilarious catchphrases.</p>
							<p>Drakes Kitchen has posted recipes for everything from 1-minute apple pie to chicken tacos. There is an element of actual cooking knowledge injected into each video, but for most of each video, ingredients are thrown around, put in containers that are not appropriate for what they are holding, and cooked in a slapstick manner. For example, whenever he needs water, he proceeds to put ice in a hot pot and heat it up. One of the defining running jokes on the account happens when Drakes Kitchen mixes something. Instead of saying, “mix the ingredients”, like most cooking tutorials, he proceeds to say, “and then mixalardo”, a made-up word that presumably means to mix. These videos provide little actual cooking help to those watching, prove to be highly entertaining. The number of views Drakes Kitchen gets on a consistent basis show that the videos are far-reaching in popularity on TikTok. </p>
							<p>Where Drakes Kitchen intersects with religion is not in the content of the videos, but in the comments section and bio of the account. When clicking on the account, you are greeted with the explanation, “I cook stuff”, but also a Bible verse: Luke 12:22-24. Thus, Drakes Kitchen starts the conversation about religion without even saying a word on the subject. </p>

					<p>As seen in the videos above, Drakes Kitchen does not explicitly mention religion in any way, shape, or form. However, the app itself has more to media consumption than just short-form videos. The comment section of each video serves as a space for users to interact with each other and react to the video or audio. It also provides an opportunity for the community and the creators to interact. In the case of Drakes Kitchen, the comment section is used as a place to share Bible verses. On each Drakes Kitchen videos, the pinned comment, placed there by the creator is a verse, typically a short, catchy Psalm or Proverb. Here is an example of each Bible verse from the videos above:	</p>
					<div class="row gtr-150">
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/chicken.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Pinned comment: Proverbs 13:4</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/nachos.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Pinned comment: Proverbs 13:10</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bread.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Pinned comment: Proverbs 13:18</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Drakes Kitchen is using the platform to bring religion to the user in a subtle manner. Specifically, Drakes Kitchen brings up religion in a space where it would typically not be found: cooking videos. Since the account makes cooking related content, the audience can be presumed to have a wide variety of backgrounds. Thus, Drakes Kitchen ends up bringing Bible verses to people who might not normally see them. Sharing the word of the Bible is a hallmark of Evangelicalism, and Drakes Kitchen is finding a new frontier on TikTok to spread the religion. </p>
					<p>Additionally, Drakes Kitchen utilizes the comment section of videos to share religion, allowing user interaction with the religious content. This is important because it allows a two-sided conversation between the content creator and the users, rather than it being one-sided as in the case of a religious-centered video. Drakes Kitchen is a popular creator, and these Bible verses are reaching millions of people, a majority of which are Gen Z. While not explicit in his faith in video form, Drakes Kitchen brings people closer to the conversation about Christianity by introducing them to easy to digest nuggets of the Bible. </p>

							<h2>Josh Benson: Religiosity and Humor</h2>
						</header>
						<p>“JoshBensontheRapper”, or Josh Benson, has become one of the most famous TikTok creators in the Evangelical Christian corner of the app. He has amassed a following of almost half a million users and has garnered over 25 million likes on his videos. Benson and his sketch comedy walks the fine line of making fun of Evangelical Christianity, while also belonging to the community as well. His humor is both inward-facing, where he talks about experiences in youth group and inside of a large church, and outward-facing, in poking fun at common experiences for high school students.</p>
						<p>There are very few, if any videos, on Benson’s account in which he is being himself. In most cases, he is portraying a character that is familiar to those in the church-going Evangelical Christian community. Sometimes he throws on a backwards snapback hat and poses as “Church Chad” or will don a kitchen towel on his head and act like “Church Chelsea”, or “Christian Mom”. In playing these characters, he brings up serious topics like marriage, political division, and corruption, hot button issues for many Evangelical Churches today. But at the bottom of all the jokes, Benson continues to push the basics of the faith and share elements of the Gospel in his TikToks.</p>
						<p>Benson also makes fun of many non-Christian experiences as well, for example, he reenacts what it is like to play football in Texas (and line up against some of the most talented players in the country) and portrays “every Holiday Hallmark movie ever”. The mix of religious and non-religious content on Benson’s account is what makes his account appeal to a wide range of people. Additionally, many of his jokes appeal to a young audience, that is either still in high school or just recently graduated. </p>

				<p>Benson’s account offers a powerful marketing tool for Evangelism. Maya Jadarat interviews Gabe Poirot, a fellow Evangelical TikToker in the Deseret News article: “Can TikTok bring Gen Z into the fold?”. She finds that, “When Poirot talks about evangelism on TikTok, he’s talking about making contact and getting viewers interested enough so they’ll want to know more. A 30-second video never changed anyone’s life, he says. What it does is it gives exposure to the gospel.” Benson’s account and use of humor certainly falls into this category. The videos in which he covers non-religious content get people interested in the account where they stumble upon religious content. While an outsider may not fully understand the context of every dig or pun, Benson poses a very attractive form of Christianity: one that is able to take jokes and laugh a little. </p>

							<h2>Elijah Lamb: Overt Content</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Elijah Lamb is one of the biggest Evangelical-lifestyle TikTok accounts on the platform. The account follows the life, musings, and the spiritual lessons offered by Elijah Lamb. Lamb has almost 700 thousand followers and importantly, is a member of Gen Z himself. Unlike Benson, Lamb portrays his actual life on the app and does not play a character. Lamb embodies many of the qualities that would qualify him as a Christian influencer. </p>
						<p>Most of Lamb’s videos are studies of scripture from the Bible and thoughts from the self-made 20-year-old preacher. The content he posts offers words of wisdom to his target audience: Generation Z. Since Lamb is of the “Zoomer” generation himself, he can relate to the issues and feelings of the young people watching his videos. This gives him more credibility than say, a local pastor might have. Lamb offers words of encouragement in the form of interpretations of scripture and his own life experiences. </p>
						<p>The rest of Elijah Lamb’s videos show what his day-to-day life is like. It involves trying Octopus with friends, going on runs to the bookstore, and getting a haircut for the first time in an entire year after COVID. The content here is not explicitly religious, but it is good-old family-friendly fun. </p>
						<p>The account serves as an effective tool for Evangelical Christianity by showing what it can be like to live as a Christian in Gen Z. Lamb demonstrates to his young audience that they can still have a fun life as a teenager at the same time as taking religion seriously. The fact that Lamb has found himself a following on TikTok proves it is a powerful tool for Evangelization. Lamb is not offering much outside of the Christian perspective, so those who follow are there for a reason: religion. </p>

						<h4><strong>Elijah offering a perspective on sin</strong></h4>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>The overtly Evangelical content that Elijah Lamb puts on his TikTok account holds significance and real-life impacts for his followers.  Corrina Laughlin in her chapter titled “The Influencers”, in her book <u>Redeem All</u>, says “successful Christian influencers also have a type of authority—their words and actions hold weight to their followers who see them as people they might aspire to be”. Lamb provides an example to young people of what being a Christian could be. He uses TikTok to market Evangelicalism as a religion that allows followers to still enjoy being a young person, while appealing to those who want a daily devotion. As compared to other forms of social media, TikTok provides Lamb the platform and ability to create casual videos that are curated to show his entire life and walk with the Lord.</p>

							<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
						</header>
						<p>By looking at three content creators (Drakes Kitchen, Josh Benson, and Elijah Lamb), it’s clear that TikTok is a platform in which Evangelical Christians are finding a voice. These creators appeal to young people, specifically Gen Z, by posting videos on the app. TikTok itself possesses addictive qualities and hooks young people into spending hours upon hours consuming media. At the same time, Drakes Kitchen, Benson, and Lamb are able to market Christianity on the app using methods ranging from subtle messaging as in the case of Drakes Kitchen to overt sermon-like videos from Elijah Lamb. All in all, the immersive qualities of TikTok give Evangelical Christians the platform to evangelize and speak to Gen Z in ways that are only possible on the app. 						</p>
